I think I'm too young to fall in love  
I think she too sprung, I been shot-callin' her  
Yeah, uh, I think she too spoiled, she get what she want, yеah  
I just blocked her number, shе said, What you on?   
  
She said, "You trippin', you movin' Holly"
I said, "You trippin', see you on molly"
Gas, ridin' around in big bodies
Oh, that's your ho'? Link her, I said, "Copy"
I got these bands, now she can't get off me
It been a lot of niggas tryna cross me
No, it ain't shit to cut a nigga off
A blessing or lesson, nigga, what you taught?
